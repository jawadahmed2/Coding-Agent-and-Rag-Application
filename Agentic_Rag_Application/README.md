# Agentic Rag Application

This project provides a solution for parsing tabular data from PDFs and retrieve a relevant content.

## Features

- An RAG application using Llama Index to handle tabular PDF ingestion.
- A user-friendly interface for querying and retrieving relevant information from the ingested PDFs.
- PDF parsing libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, Camelot).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jawadahmed2/Coding-Agent-and-Rag-Application.git
   cd Agentic_Rag_Application
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using Poetry:

    Note: First deactivate the virtual or conda environments in the terminal

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the Poetry shell:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the application by executing the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can also modify `config.py` to adjust any configuration settings based on your needs, such as the path to PDF files.

## Notes

- This project **does not currently use a Large Language Model (LLM)**. However, incorporating an LLM for re-ranking the extracted data could enhance the accuracy and performance of the parser.
